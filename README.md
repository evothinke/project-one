# Project #one Refactoring code
Main Goal:
1. Optimizing code to make it more accessible/indexable by search engines. 
2. Optimize HTML and CSS code by shortening, structuring and removing redundant elements.

# Acceptance Criteria:

- Meets accessibility standards
- Usage of semantic HTML elements

- The main  menu has been modified so it changes color and opacity when hovered over.
- The logo has been modified so when it's pressed it takes the user to the homepage
- Semantic elements were added to fit html page standards
- redundant code has been removed
- The code has been generally optimized for better readability, user experience and optimized for search engines indexation.
